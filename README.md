# ARDUINO MOTORS UNIT PLAN
by Marieke Thomas

-----

### General Overview
This is a unit on motors for my Electrical Engineering course, which is an elective course for seniors (and a few juniors) at Bronx Science. The course has no prerequisites, so it has a mixture of students who are highly interested in Engineering and may be taking the course as an elective on top of an AP science course, and students who just need a science credit. In a normal year, all of the students in the course will have taken Coding for All, a mandatory 1-semester introductory coding class using Python. However, the course was cancelled 2 years ago due to the pandemic, so most of the students in my current class never took it, meaning that some have no experience in coding whatsoever.

In this course, the fall semester focuses on analog circuits, and the spring semester focuses on digital circuits using the Arduino, which is programmed in C++. This unit will fall late in the semester, after the Intro to Arduino, Inputs, and LCD units, and directly before the final unit which is a Shark Tank-style Final Project. The unit should fall in early May. That means that by the time we start this unit, students will (hopefully) have a significant amount of experience with programming the Arduino with LEDs, switches, potentiometers, light sensors, and LCDs. This unit will connect back to the fall semester, when we discuss the physics behind how simple motors work and build rudimentary motors.

This unit will start with 1 day of introducing motors, the different types and what they are used for, then 3 days of introducing students to servo motors, followed by 3 days of introducing students to stepper motors, and finally 3 days of working on the final project, which is to motorize a mini-windmill. The mini-windmills are built in the freshmen engineering classes using the laser cutter so students in my class will work with the freshman engineers to create the fully-spinning final product.

### Motivation for Unit
I chose to design this unit because it is a component that I wanted to include in my class last year but didn't have time to. The school already owns the servo motors and stepper motors, and several of my student groups last year incorporated motors into their final projects, teaching themselves the necessary skills in order to correctly wire and program the motors. Students are excited and curious about learning to use motors, which is always important especially when teaching second-semester seniors. I also think that this unit will be a great opportunity to spiral in our discussion of motors in the fall semester-- students will both get to understand the underlying mechanics and see how they are useful in the real world. Finally, I was motivated to design this unit because one of the freshmen engineering teachers asked if my class would be able to help add motion to his class's windmill projects.
